// Enhanced logging to capture more context around the crash (if applicable).
expo.registerRootComponent(App);

// Add detailed logs before critical operations to track down potential crash points in your app code.

// Example: Log before network requests or significant computations.
// ... your app code

// Additional debugging steps:
// 1. Check for errors in the device's logs (Android Logcat, iOS console).
// 2. Simplify the application gradually to isolate problematic components (remove modules one by one).
// 3. Try a different device/emulator.
// 4. Check for conflicting packages or updated dependencies.
// 5. Clean and rebuild the project.
// 6. Upgrade to the latest Expo CLI version.
// 7. Report issue on the official Expo GitHub page if the problem persists after trying these steps.
