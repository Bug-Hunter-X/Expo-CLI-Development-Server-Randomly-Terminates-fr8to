# Expo CLI Development Server Random Termination

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server randomly terminates without providing any clear error messages in the console. This issue is inconsistent and only appears on certain devices and platforms.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the development server's behavior. It might work flawlessly for some time before unexpectedly terminating without an error.

## Potential Causes
* Underlying device or emulator issues.
* Conflicting packages or dependencies.
* Unexpected interactions between Expo and device-specific settings.
* Bugs within Expo CLI itself (less likely).

## Proposed Solution (expoBugSolution.js):
This issue is tricky to solve directly as it is highly circumstantial. The provided solution is a diagnostic approach to pinpoint the cause using logging and debugging practices.  It does not provide a universal fix, as the root cause is unpredictable. 

## Note
The provided solution is largely centered around diagnostic logging and careful observation, making it harder to isolate into a concise code snippet within a JSON structure.
